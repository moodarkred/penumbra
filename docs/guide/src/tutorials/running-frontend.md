# Running a frontend

In order to use the [Prax wallet] web extension, users must visit a trusted
website that leverages the web extension in order to interact with the Penumbra network.
While users can choose to grant access to website run by a party they trust,
this guide demonstrates how a user can self-host a frontend for use by themselves and others.

## Frontend embedded in fullnode

If you're already [running a fullnode](./running-node.md), then you don't need to do anything else:
a bundled version of the frontend code is available at `https://<YOUR_NODE_URL>/app`. Simply navigate
to that site after installing Prax, and authorize the web extension to connect to it.
